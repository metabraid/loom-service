About the Service
=================

Metabraid Loom is a collection of RESTful APIs for generating and installing
application sourcecode to a devops pipeline.

Conceptually analogous to [Jacquard Loom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacquard_loom), Metabraid Loom automates the "weaving of data yarns and data loops through multiple devops heddles to form a system tapestry".
